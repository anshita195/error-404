This is the project for freshers track of syntaxerror2023 by team Error 404
In this project, we have built a movie recommendation system wherein we ask the users a set of questions and suggest them movies based on their answers.
We ask the user for which genre and language they would prefer and even their mood while watching the movie. Based on that, we suggest them the movies to watch.
It can help users get a really personalized set of recommendations depending on their choices and how exactly they are feeling.
Future scope:
The system can be improved by using more advanced technologies like machine learning. We can also incorporate the database of the watch history, etc. of the users for making the algorithm better with more personalized results.
