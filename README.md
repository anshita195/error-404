In this project, we have built a movie recommendation system wherein we ask the users a set of questions and suggest them movies based on their answers.
We ask the user for which genre and language they would prefer and even their mood while watching the movie. Based on that, we suggest them the movies to watch.
It can help users get a really personalized set of recommendations depending on their choices and how exactly they are feeling.
